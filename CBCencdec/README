This is Carl Chinatomby's Submission for Lab#1 for
the Spring 2011 CSC 48000 Computer Security Course
taught by Professor Nelly Fazio. 

Included is a test.sh file that I used to test my program
I also have a typescript file to show some of the output.
Since typescripts aren't runnable, i used the test.sh file
whenever a change was made to ensure no bugs were introduced
in my change.
