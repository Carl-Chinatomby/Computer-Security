<h2 class="subtitle bar"><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>
In this lab, you will build a simple encryption/decryption utility.
The utility will allow you to generate private key/public key pairs
for an Adaptive Chosen-Ciphertext (CCA) secure Public-Key Encryption
scheme.  You can then exchange your public key with your friends, and
they will be able to encrypt files under your public key, so that only
you can recover the original plaintext. By doing the lab, you will
gain experience about how to use Cryptography to build security
properties into your system.

<p>
We provide you with a simple cryptographic library (<a
href="../lab0/libdcrypt-0.5.tar.gz"><tt>libdcrypt</tt></a>),
containing an implementation of all the cryptographic tools you will
need for the lab. (See <a href="../lab0/install-libs.html">Lab0</a>
for instructions on how to install this library in your machine.)  

<h2 class="subtitle bar"><a name="setup"></a>Software Setup</h2>
<p>
We have prepared <a href="lab1.tar.gz"><tt>skeleton files</tt></a> to
help you get started with the lab.  To set up the files on your
account, download <a href="lab1.tar.gz"><tt>lab1.tar.gz</tt></a>, and
type the following: 
<pre class="samp">
% <span class="type">tar xzf lab1.tar.gz</span>
% <span class="type">cd lab1</span>
% 
</pre>

<h2 class="subtitle bar"><a name="labspec"></a>Lab Specification</h2>

<p>
Your Encryption/Decryption Utility will consist of three programs:
<code>edu_keygen</code>, <code>edu_encrypt</code> and
<code>edu_decrypt</code>.  We provide you with a skeleton source
directory (<a href="lab1.tar.gz"><tt>lab1.tar.gz</tt></a>), containing
the following files:

<pre class="samp">
% <span class="type">ls lab1/</span>
Makefile        edu_decrypt.c   edu_keygen.c
edu.h           edu_encrypt.c   edu_misc.c
%
</pre>

<p>
***(The provided <a href="Makefile"><tt>Makefile</tt></a> assumes that
you will be doing the assignment on the Linux lab machines (NAC 7/105,
NAC 7/106).  If you are working on your machine, see the <a
href="#makefilenote">note below</a>.)***
<p>
Once you have implemented the necessary functions (see <a
href="#design">below</a>), you will build the three programs
<code>edu_keygen</code>, <code>edu_encrypt</code> and
<code>edu_decrypt</code> using <code>make</code>:

<pre class="samp">
% <span class="type">make</span>
gcc -g -O2 -ansi -Wall -Wsign-compare -Wchar-subscripts -Werror -I. -I/usr/inclu
de/ -I/home/cslab/faculty/fazio/libdcrypt/include/ -c edu_keygen.c edu_misc.c

du_decrypt.o edu_misc.o -L. -L/usr/lib/ -L/home/cslab/faculty/fazio/libdcrypt/li
b/  -ldcrypt  -lgmp
%
</pre>

<p>
You should now be able to create your own private key/public key
pair, and use them as follows:

<pre class="samp">
% <span class="type">./edu_keygen my_key.priv my_key.pub</span> 
% <span class="type">yes "test" | head -1000 > a_file</span>
% <span class="type">./edu_encrypt my_key.pub a_file an_encrypted_file</span>
% <span class="type">./edu_decrypt my_key.priv an_encrypted_file a_decrypted_file</span> 
% <span class="type">diff a_file a_decrypted_file</span>
%
</pre>

<p>
Now you think, "This is cool!," and decide to give a copy of your
encryption/decryption utility to your friend (whose name, surprise,
surprise, we will assume is Bob). Now that Bob has your program, you
can exchange public keys: 

<pre class="samp">
% <span class="type">cat my_key.pub | mail bob@bobserver.org</span> 
%
</pre>

<p>
Once Bob gets your email ...
<pre class="samp">
bob>
You have mail in /var/mail/bob
</pre>

... he will store your public key in a file named, let's say,
<code>alice.pub</code>. Now Bob can send you highly confidential messages:

<pre class="samp">
bob> <span class="type">echo "The deadline for lab1 is March 30" > msg.plain</span> 
bob> <span class="type"> ./edu_encrypt alice.pub msg.plain msg.cipher</span> 
bob> <span class="type">uuencode -m msg.cipher bob_msg.cipher | mail alice@aliceserver.org</span>
bob>
</pre>

When you get Bob's email:

<pre class="samp">
% <span class="type">...</span>
You have mail in /var/mail/alice
</pre>

... you will uudecode it, obtaining a ciphertext file named
<code>bob_msg.cipher</code>, and then you will use your private key to
unveil Bob's top-secret communication:

<pre class="samp">
% <span class="type">./edu_decrypt my_key.priv bob_msg.cipher bob_msg.plain</span> 
% <span class="type">cat bob_msg.plain</span> 
The deadline for lab1 is March 30
</pre>


<p><a name="makefilenote"></a><b>Note on setting up lab1 if you are
*not* working on the Linux lab machines</b><br /> 

If you have <a href="../lab0/install-libs.html">installed the
libraries</a> on your own machine, you may need to edit the
<a href="Makefile"><tt>Makefile</tt></a> that was provided in
<a href="lab1.tar.gz"><tt>lab1.tar.gz</tt></a>.  <br />
Locate the following lines (toward the beginning of
<a href="Makefile"><tt>Makefile</tt></a>):

<pre>
INCLUDES = /usr/include/

DCRYPTINCLUDE = /home/cslab/faculty/fazio/libdcrypt/include/          
DCRYPTLIB = /home/cslab/faculty/fazio/libdcrypt/lib/

Next, edit these lines so that:

<ul>
<li> <code>INCLUDES</code> and <code>LIBS</code> point to the

<li> <code>DCRYPINCLUDE</code> and <code>DCRYPTLIB</code> point to the
     directories containing respectively the headers and lib files for
     <tt>dcrypt</tt>.
</ul>

<h2 class="subtitle bar"><a name="design"></a>Design Guidelines</h2>

<p>
Now that you know how your encryption/decryption utility is supposed
to work, let's get into doing something.

<p>
To help you get acquainted with <a
href="../lab0/libdcrypt-0.3.tar.gz"><tt>libdcrypt</tt></a>, we implemented 
<code>edu_keygen</code> for you: take a look at <a
href="edu.h"><code>edu.h</code></A>, 
<a href="edu_misc.c"><code>edu_misc.c</code></a>
and <a href="edu_keygen.c"><code>edu_keygen.c</code></a>,
and make sure you understand what's going on.

<p>
We also provide you with an incomplete implementation of
<code>edu_encrypt</code> and <code>edu_decrypt</code> in <a
href="edu_encrypt.c" ><code>edu_encrypt.c</code></a> and <a
href="edu_decrypt.c" ><code>edu_decrypt.c</code></a>.  Your job is to
fill in the code for the two procedures:

<ul>
<li><code>void encrypt_file (const char *ctxt_fname, dckey *pk, int
fin)</code> (in <a href="edu_encrypt.c"
><code>edu_encrypt.c</code></a>) <li><code>void decrypt_file (const
char *ptxt_fname, dckey *sk, int fin)</code> (in <a
href="edu_decrypt.c" ><code>edu_decrypt.c</code></a>) </ul>

<h4>Encrypting the content</h4>

The task of <code>encrypt_file</code> is to read the content from the
file descriptor <code>fin</code>, encrypt it using <code>pk</code>,
and place the resulting ciphertext in a file named <code>ctxt_fname</code>.

<p>
The encryption should be <b>CCA-secure</b>,
which is the level of cryptographic protection that you should always
expect of any implementation of an encryption algorithm.

<p> 
Below we describe a possible design, based on the so-called
"hybrid encryption" paradigm, but you are free to follow a different 
approach if you want, as long as it is also CCA-secure.
 
The "hybrid encryption" paradigm combines both public-key and symmetric
encryption functions: the idea is to:
<ol>
<li> pick a random symmetric key <code>K</code> and encrypt it under
the public key <code>pk</code>; and
<li> use <code>K</code> to encrypt the  actual content read from the
<code>fin</code> file descriptor using <em>e.g.,</em> AES.
</ol>

<p>
For this to be secure, the public-key encryption scheme used to encrypt 
<code>K</code> must be CCA-secure (but you don't have to worry about
this; the public-key encryption functions included in the library you
are going to use are all CCA-secure).

<p>
The symmetric encryption part must also be CCA-secure: one good approach
is to use AES in CBC-mode (described <a href="#cbc">below</a>), and then
append an HMAC SHA-1 mac of the resulting ciphertext. 
<span class="important">Always mac after encrypting!</span>

<p>
The <code>dcrypt</code> library contains implementations of AES 
and of HMAC SHA-1 (cf. <a href="#functions"> Useful functions</a>).
<span class="important">However, you should take care of using AES in
CBC-mode, as the library only gives access to the basic AES block
cipher functionality, which is <em>not</em> CCA-secure.</span>

<p>
Notice that the key used to compute the HMAC SHA-1 mac must be
different from the one used by AES.  <span class="important">Never use
the same cryptographic key for two different purposes: bad
interference could occur.</span> <br> For this reason, the key
<code>K</code> encrypted under the public key <code>pk</code> actually
consists of two pieces, one for AES and one for HMAC SHA-1. The length
of both pieces (and hence the cryptographic strength of the
encryption) is specified by the constant <code>CCA_STRENGTH</code> in
<a href="edu.h">edu.h</a>; the default is 128 bits, or 16 bytes.

<p>
Recall that AES can only encrypt blocks of 128 bits, so you should use
some padding in the case that the length (in bytes) of the plaintext 
is not a multiple of 16.  This should be done in a way that allow proper 
decoding after decryption: in particular,  the recipient must have a way 
to know where the padding begins so that it can be chopped off. 

<p>
One possible design is to add enough 0 bytes to the plaintext so as to
make its length a multiple of 16, and then append a byte at the end
specifying how many zero-bytes were appended.

<p>
Thus, the overall layout of an encrypted file will be:

<blockquote>
<pre>
         +-----+-----------+--------------------------+---+--------+
         | X_l |     X     |             Y            | W | padlen |
         +-----+-----------+--------------------------+---+--------+

where X = PKE (pk, {K_AES, K_HSHA-1})
      X_l = length of X in bytes
      Y = CBC-AES (K_AES, {plaintext, 0^padlen})
      W = HMAC-SHA-1 (K_HSHA-1, Y)
      padlen = no. of zero-bytes added to the plaintext to make its
               length a multiple of 16
</pre> 
</blockquote> 

As for the sizes of the various components of a ciphertext file, notice
that:
<uL>
<li>
<code>X_l</code> is two-byte-long, 

<li>
<code>X</code> consists of <code>X_l</code> bytes, 

<li>
the length of <code>Y</code> (in bytes) is a multiple of 16, 

<li>
the hash value <code>HSHA-1 (K_HSHA-1, Y)</code> is 20-byte-long, and 

<li>
<code>padlen</code> is a sigle byte.
</ul>

<h4>Decrypting the content</h4>

The task of <code>decrypt_file</code> is to read the ciphertext from
the file descriptor <code>fin</code>, decrypt it using
<code>sk</code>, and place the resulting plaintext in a file named
<code>ptxt_fname</code>.

<p>
This procedure basically should just "undo" the operations performed
by <code>encrypt_file</code>; for this reason,
<code>decrypt_file</code> expects a ciphertext featuring the structure
described above. 

<p>
Notice that reading in <code>X</code> (i.e., the piece of
ciphertext that encapsulates the symmetric keys used to encrypt and mac
the actual file content) is easy, as its length is prefixed, so we
know exactly how many bytes to read.  

<p>
Reading <code>Y</code> (and then the mac and the pad length) is a
bit trickier: below we sketch one possible approach, but you are free
to implement this as you wish.

<p>
The idea is based on the fact that the ciphertext file ends with 21
bytes (i.e., the size of a hash + 1) used up by the HSHA-1 mac and by
the pad length.  Thus, we will repeatedly attempt to perform "long
reads" of (<code>aes_blocklen</code> + <code>sha1_hashsize</code> + 2)
bytes: once we get to the end of the ciphertext and only the last
chunk of <code>Y</code> has to be read, such "long reads" will
encounter the end-of-file, at which point we will know where
<code>Y</code> ends, and how to finish reading the last bytes of the
ciphertext.

<a name="cbc" class="anchor"><h4>Cipher-Block Chaining (CBC) Mode</h4></a>

For encrypting a stream of bytes that does not require random access,
people often employ a technique known as <em>Cipher-Block
Chaining</em> (CBC). To encrypt in CBC mode, one thinks of the stream
of bytes as a sequence of block, each of the size of the block cipher
being used (AES in your case); then, one XORs each plaintext block
with the encryption of the previous block before encrypting, as shown
here:

<blockquote>
<img src=cbc.gif alt="Ciphertext-Block Chaining">
</blockquote>
 
If the plaintext blocks are m<sub>1</sub>, m<sub>2</sub>, ..., and the
ciphertext blocks c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>, ..., then encryption
and decryption in CBC mode are performed as follows:

<blockquote>
c<sub>i</sub> = E(m<sub>i</sub> XOR c<sub>i-1</sub>)<br>
m<sub>i</sub> = D(c<sub>i</sub>) XOR c<sub>i-1</sub>
</blockquote>

The first plaintext block is XORed with an initialization vector, or
IV (which you can think of as c<sub>0</sub>, since there is no
m<sub>0</sub>).  The IV can be publicly known, but should be chosen
afresh at random each time the same key will be used to encrypt, so
that each ciphertext uses a different IV.

<h3><font color=red>Extra credit</font></h3>

The current implementation of <code>edu_keygen</code> stores the
private key in a file with permissions set to
<code>0600</code>&mdash;readable only by the owner.  This protects your
private key from other users in your system, but won't prevent your
system administrator from reading it.  A better design would be to
prompt the user for a passphrase, and then use (a hash of) the
passphrase to encrypt the private key before storing it to the file.

<p>
For extra credit, modify <code>edu_keygen</code> so that it prompts
for a passphrase twice, aborting if the two passphrases do not
match.  (Asking for the passphrase twice protects from the case 
that you mistype your passphrase&mdash;otherwise, on later access you 
will remember the password you wanted to type, but may not easily 
be able to figure out what you actually typed.) 

<p>
You will also need to modify <code>edu_decrypt</code> so that it also
prompts for a passphrase, and uses it to decrypt the ciphertext 
containing the private key.  Then, you should be able to run the
<code>edu_keygen</code>, <code>edu_encrypt</code> and
<code>edu_encrypt</code> programs as follows:

<pre class="samp">
% <span class="type">./edu_keygen my_key.priv my_key.pub</span>
Passphrase for my_key.priv:
                     Again:     
% <span class="type">yes "test" | head -1000 > a_file</span>
% <span class="type">./edu_encrypt my_key.pub a_file an_encrypted_file</span>
% <span class="type">./edu_decrypt my_key.priv an_encrypted_file a_decrypted_file</span> 
Passphrase for my_key.priv:
% <span class="type">diff a_file a_decrypted_file</span>
%
</pre>

You may find the following function helpful to read in the passphrase:

<blockquote>
<code>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</code><br>
<br>
<code>char *getpass(const char *prompt);</code><br>

Displays <code>prompt</code> to the user and reads a password typed at
the terminal, turning off echo so that others cannot see the password
typed.  The password is returned as a pointer to a
<code>NULL</code>-terminated ANSI C string.
</blockquote>

<p>
Include in the handin directory a short text file called
<code>extra-credit</code> with a description of the exact technique
you used to implement this feature.

<h2 class="subtitle bar"><a name="policy"></a>Collaboration Policy</h2>

<p>
You must write all the code you hand in for the programming assignments,
except for code that we give you as part of the assigment. You are
not allowed to look at anyone else's solution. You may discuss the
assignments with other students, but you may not look at or copy
each others' code.  You may not use code that might be available 
online.

<h2 class="subtitle bar"><a name="handin"></a>Hand-In Procedure</h2>

<p>
You must submit two files:
<ul>
  <li>A software distribution of your encryption/decryption utility;
  <li>A script file showing how you tested your programs.
</ul>

<p>
To build a software distribution, run the following commands (from the
directory where your source files are located):

<pre class="samp">
% <span class="type">cd ..</span>
% <span class="type">tar cf edu.tar lab1/</span>
% <span class="type">gzip edu.tar</span>
%
</pre>

(If the name of the directory containing your sources is not
<code>lab1</code>, then substitute the appropriate name in the
second command above.)

<p>
To create a script file, use the <span class="type">script</span>
command.  When you run script, everything you type gets saved in a
file called typescript.  Press CTRL-D to finish the script.  
For example:

<pre class="samp">
% <span class="type">script</span>
Script started, output file is typescript
% <span class="type">./edu_keygen my_key.priv my_key.pub</span> 
% <span class="type">yes "test" | head -1000 > a_file</span>
% <span class="type">./edu_encrypt my_key.pub a_file an_encrypted_file</span>
% <span class="type">./edu_decrypt my_key.priv an_encrypted_file a_decrypted_file</span>
% <span class="type">diff a_file a_decrypted_file</span>
% <span class="type"></span>
% <span class="type">...</span>
% <span class="type">yes "test" | head -1015 > a_file</span>
% <span class="type">./edu_encrypt my_key.pub a_file an_encrypted_file</span>
% <span class="type">./edu_decrypt my_key.priv an_encrypted_file a_decrypted_file</span>
% <span class="type">diff a_file a_decrypted_file</span>
% <span class="type"></span>
% <span class="type">^D</span>
% <span class="type">^D</span> Script done, output file is typescript 
% 
</pre>

<p>
To turn in your distribution and script file, e-mail the files
<code>edu.tar.gz</code> and <code>typescript</code> to me at <t>"fazio
AT cs DOT ccny DOT cuny DOT edu"</t> by March 30, 11:59pm.

<p>
<b>This completes the lab.</b>

<hr>

<h2 class="subtitle bar"><a name="functions"></a>Useful Functions</h2>

<p>
Below is a description of some of the functions implemented in the 
<a href="../lab0/libdcrypt-0.5.tar.gz"><tt>dcrypt</tt></a> library
that you may find useful in completing the assignment. You will need
to include the <a href="../lab0/libdcrypt-0.5/dcrypt.h"><tt>dcrypt.h</tt></a>
header file to access these functions.  You may also want to take a
look at these sample programs (<a href="../lab0/libdcrypt-0.5/tst.c">tst.c</a>, 
<a href="../lab0/libdcrypt-0.5/tst_sha1.c">tst_sha1.c</a>)
to see some of these functions in action.

<h3>Data serialization</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>void putint (void *dp, u_int32_t val);</code>
<li><code>void puthyper (void *dp, u_int64_t val);</code><br>
The <code>putint</code> function puts the 32-bit integer value of
<code>val</code> into memory in big-endian order at location
<code>dp</code>.  <code>dp</code> does not need to be aligned.  The
bytes stored at <code>dp</code> will be the same on big- and
little-endian machines.  <code>puthyper</code> is like
<code>putint</code> but puts a 64-bit value into 8 bytes of memory.

<p>
<li><code>u_int32_t getint (const void *dp);</code>
<li><code>u_int64_t gethyper (const void *dp);</code><br>
The <code>getint</code> and <code>gethyper</code> routines retrieve
values stored by <code>putint</code> and <code>puthyper</code>
respectively.

<p>
<li><code>char *armor64 (const void *dp, size_t len);</code><br>
Transforms <code>len</code> bytes from the binary string pointed by
<code>dp</code> to a longer, base-64, printable ASCII string.  You
will need to use this to transform random session keys (which could
contain zero-bytes) into a <code>NULL</code>-terminated ANSI C string.  

<p>
<li><code>ssize_t dearmor64 (void *out, const char *s);</code><br>
Inverts the <code>armor64</code> function, and return the number of
bytes that were placed at <code>out</code>.  The return value is
negative if the <code>NULL</code>-terminated ANSI C string
<code>s</code> is not the output of <code>armor64</code>. 

<p>
<li><code>ssize_t armor64len (const char *s);</code><br>
Tries to find an armored string starting at the byte pointed to by 
<code>s</code>.  If some prefix of <code>s</code> represents a valid
armor64 string, then the length of such prefix is returned.  Otherwise,
-1 is returned, indicating that s is not the output of <code>armor64</code>.

<p>
<li><code>ssize_t dearmor64len (const char *s);</code><br>
Tries to find an armored string starting at the byte pointed to by 
<code>s</code>.  If some prefix of <code>s</code> represents a valid
armor64 string, then the length of the decoded data that would result
by "dearmoring" <code>s</code> is returned.  Otherwise, -1 is
returned, indicating that s is not the output of <code>armor64</code>. 
</ul>

<h3>Pseudo-Random Number Generation Functions</h3>
<p>

The libraries you are using contain a cryptographic pseudo-random
number generator, whose state is kept in a global 16-byte array called
<code>prng_state</code>.  Before using the random number generator,
you must initialize it. 

<ul>
<li><code>void prng_seed (void *buf, size_t len);</code><br>

This function initializes the state of the random number generator
using <code>len</code> bytes from <code>buf</code> as seed.  Providing
a good seed may be a difficult task; some Operating Systems
(including FreeBSD, OpenBSD and most Linux distributions) provide
you with a source of randomness under <code>/dev/random</code> (or one
of its variants: <code>/dev/srandom</code>, <code>/dev/urandom</code>,
<em>etc.</em>).  If a <code>random</code> 
device is available, you should read (at least) 128 bits from it and
use it as a seed; otherwise, as a <b><em>very rough</em></b>
approximation, you could supply some information about your local
machine (<em>e.g.,</em> time of the day, PID/GID value) that is
difficult to predict.  

<p>
<li><code>void prng_getbytes (void *buf, size_t len);</code><br>
Writes <code>len</code> pseudo-random bytes to memory at location
<code>buf</code>.

<p>
<li><code>u_int32_t prng_getword ();</code><br>
<li><code>u_int64_t prng_gethyper ();</code><br>
These functions return a single pseudo-random 32- or 64-bit integer,
respectively.
</ul>

<h3>Symmetric-Key Encryption Functions</h3>
<p>
For actually encrypting and decrypting file data, you will use the <a
href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf">Rijndael</a>
<b>[FIPS-197]</b> block cipher (also called <span
class="type">AES</span>&mdash;Advanced 
Encryption Standard).  Rijndael is a 128-bit block cipher.  It
supports two 
operations--encryption, and decryption.  Encryption transforms 16
bytes (128 bits) of <i>plaintext</i> data into 16 bytes of
<i>ciphertext</i> data using a secret key.  Someone who does not know
the secret key cannot recover the plaintext from the ciphertext.  The
decryption algorithm, given knowledge of the secret key, transforms
ciphertext into plaintext.

<p>
The libraries you are using define a <code>struct</code> called
<code>aes_ctx</code> that you should use to hold secret keys for AES.
You should manipulate your AES secret keys with the following functions:

<ul>
<li><code>void aes_setkey (aes_ctx *aes, const void *key, u_int
len);</code><br> 

This sets the secret encryption key using <code>len</code> bytes fro
the buffer <code>key</code>.  <b>The key must be 16-, 24-, or
32-long.</b> 

<p>
<li><code>void aes_encrypt (const aes_ctx *aes, void *buf, const void
*ibuf);</code><br> 

<code>aes_encrypt</code> transforms 16 bytes of plaintext data at
<code>ibuf</code> into 16 bytes of ciphertext data which it writes to
<code>buf</code>.  It uses the secret key previously stored within 
<code>aes</code> using the <code>aes_setkey</code> function.

<p>
<li><code>void aes_decrypt (const aes_ctx *aes, void *buf, const void
*ibuf);</code><br> 

<code>aes_decrypt</code> decrypts 16 bytes, inverting the
<code>aes_encrypt</code> function.

<p>
<li><code>void aes_clrkey (aes_ctx *aes);</code><br> 

This clears the content of <code>aes</code>, thus wiping out the secret
encryption key that was previosly stored there. <br>
<span class="important">Once you are done with a secret key, you
should always wipe out the memory location where the secret key was
stored!</span> The Operating System safeguards your memory from
external processes only while that piece of memory is assigned to your
program: once your program exits, the memory location used to store
your precious secret key could be assigned to another process,
jeopardizing the security of your application.
</ul>

<h3>Public-Key Encryption Functions</h3>
<p>
If you only used symmetric-key cryptography, you would need to
exchange a secret key with all the friends with whom you want to have
confidential communication.  With Public-Key Cryptography, instead,
you can give all your friend the same public key, and they will be
able to send you encrypted content that only you can recover.
Similarly, you only need to know your friend's public key to create a
ciphertext that only he/she will be able to decrypt.

The libraries you are going to use contain an implementation of two
very well-known Public-Key Encryption schemes: Rabin <b>[Wil80]</b> and
ElGamal <b>[ElG86]</b>
To complete the assignment, you don't need to know anything about how
these schemes work, except for the interface that they provide, which
is described below:

<ul>
<li><code>dckey *dckeygen (const char *type, size_t k, const char
*extra);</code><br>  

Returns a pointer to a <code>struct</code> that holds a new private
key/public key pair, of the type specified by <code>type</code>.  The
value of <code>type</code> should be one of the constants defined in 
<a href="../lab0/libdcrypt-0.5/dcrypt.h"><code>dcrypt.h</code></a>, namely
<code>DC_ELGAMAL</code> or <code>DC_RABIN</code>.

<p>
The cryptographic strength of the key pair generated can be tuned
using the parameter <code>k</code>: a value of at least 1024 is
recommended to get a reasonable level of security.

<p>
The value of <code>extra</code> should be either <code>NULL</code>, or
an ASCII string representing information about the parameters that
should be used in generating the private key/public key pair.<br>  For
this assignment, you can always supply a value of <code>NULL</code>.

<p>
Notice that the <code>dckeygen</code> function internally makes use of
the pseudo-random number generator provided by <code>libdcrypt</code>:
therefore, you shouldn't call <code>dckeygen</code> before
initializing the pseudo-random number generator with <code>prng_seed</code>.

<p>
<li><code>char *dcexport_pub (const dckey *key);</code>
<li><code>char *dcexport_priv (const dckey *key);</code><br>

The <code>dcexport_pub</code> and <code>dcexport_priv</code> functions
return a base-64, printable, <code>NULL</code>-terminated ANSI C
string representing the public key or private key stored within
<code>key</code>, respectively. 

<p>
<li><code>dckey *dcimport_pub (const char *asc);</code>
<li><code>dckey *dcimport_priv (const char *asc);</code><br>

The <code>dcimport_pub</code> and <code>dcimport_priv</code> functions
retrieve the <code>dckey</code> that was previously exported into
the ASCII string <code>asc</code> using <code>dcexport_pub</code> or
<code>dcexport_priv</code>, respectively.

<P> 
If <code>asc</code> is not of the form expected,
<code>dcimport_pub</code> and <code>dcimport_priv</code> return
<code>NULL</code>. 

<p>
<li><code>char *dcencrypt (const dckey *key, const char *msg);</code><br>

<code>dcencrypt</code> uses the public key contained in
<code>key</code> to transform the plaintext data contained in the
<code>NULL</code>-terminated ANSI C string <code>msg</code> into a 
<code>NULL</code>-terminated ANSI C ciphertext string, which is
returned as output.

<p>The encryption algorithm used is CCA-secure.

<p>
Since <code>dcencrypt</code> expects the plaintext to be a 
<code>NULL</code>-terminated ANSI C string, you should use
the <code>armor64</code> function if you need to encrypt an arbitrary
bit string (such as a secret key for AES).

<p>
<li><code>char *dcdecrypt (const dckey *key, const char *cmsg);</code><br> 

<code>aes_decrypt</code> decrypts the ciphertext contained in the 
<code>NULL</code>-terminated ANSI C string <code>cmsg</code>,
inverting the <code>dcencrypt</code> function.

<p>
<li><code>void dcfree (dckey *key);</code><br> 

This clears the content of <code>key</code>.  
<span class="important">Once you are done with a private key, you
should always wipe out the memory location where it was stored!</span>

<p>
<li><code>int dcispriv (const dckey *key);</code><br>

Returns a non-zero value if the key contained in the <code>key</code>
is a private key; otherwise it returns 0. 
</ul>


<h3>Cryptographic Hash Functions</h3>
<p>
The <a
href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-1/fips180-1.pdf">SHA-1</a>
<b>[FIPS-180-1]</b> hash function hashes an arbitrary-length input (up
to 2^64 bytes) to a 
20-byte output.  SHA-1 is known as a cryptographic hash function.
While nothing has been formally proven about the function, it is
generally assumed that SHA-1 is one-way and collision-resistant.
These properties are defined as follows:

<ul>
<li>A <i>one-way</i> function is a function that is cheap to compute,
but computationally intractable to invert.  For example, Unix uses a
one-way hash function to hash users' passwords, and stores password
hashes rather than actual passwords.  When a user logs in, the user
types a password, Unix hashes this password and compares the new hash
to the one stored.  If they match, the login is successful.

<p>For someone who steals the file of password hashes, there is no
known way of recovering passwords more efficient than guessing
passwords and verifying the guesses.  (Of course, the fact that users
often choose easily-guessed passwords is a problem.)

<p>
<li>A <i>collision-resistant</i> hash function is one for which it is
computationally intractable to find any two inputs that yield the same
output.  In the case of SHA-1, there are, of course, a huge number of
collisions.  One can see this by a simple counting argument--there are
2^55,340,232,221,128,654,848 possible inputs to the function and only
2^160 possible output values.  Nonetheless, no one has ever succeeded
in finding two inputs producing the same output--even cryptographers
specifically analyzing the algorithm for this purpose.

<p>
Collision-resistant functions have many uses, stemming from the fact
that the short output value effectively uniquely specifies an
arbitrary-length input.  One cannot recover the input from the output,
but given the input, one can verify that it does, indeed, match the
output.  One might, for instance, implement a web cache in which
contents is indexed by a SHA-1 hash of the URL.  Having fixed-length
names for stored content would simplify the implementation.
</ul>

The libraries you are using contain an implementation of SHA-1.

<ul>
<li><code>void sha1_hash (void *digest, const void *buf, size_t
len);</code><br> 

Hashes <code>len</code> bytes of data at <code>buf</code>, and places
the resulting 20 bytes at <code>digest</code>.
</ul>

<p>
Sometimes the input that you want to hash is so long that it is
inconvenient to store it entirely in memory before being able to
hash it.  This is the case for example when hashing the entire content
of a file into a short digest.  <br>
For this reason, the libraries you are using allow you to process a
long input "one chunk at a time."  To do that, you should use a
<code>struct</code> called <code>sha1_ctx</code>, which will store the
"partial digest" as you keep providing new input to be hashed.  You
should manipulate <code>sha1_ctx</code> <code>struct</code>s with the
following functions: 

<p>
<ul>
<li><code>void sha1_init (sha1_ctx *sc);</code><br>

Initializes the <code>sha1_ctx struct</code> that will contain the
partial hash.

<p>
<li><code>void sha1_update (sha1_ctx *sc, const void *data, size_t
len);</code><br> 

Adds <code>len</code> bytes at <code>data</code> to the input being
hashed, but does not produce a result.  Thus, one can hash a large
amount of data without having it all in memory, by calling
<code>sha1_update</code> on one chunk at a time.

<p>
<li><code>void sha1_final (sha1_ctx *sc, void *digest);</code><br>

Produces the final hash, and places the resulting 20 bytes at
<code>digest</code>. 
</ul>

<h3>Message Authentication Codes (MACs)</h3>
<p>
Message Authentication Codes (MACs) are a symmetric-key primitive 
allowing you to check the integrity of the information to which the
MAC is applied. 
<span class="important">Recall that encryption <em>does not</em>
guarantee integrity!</span>
 The fact that you were able to decrypt a ciphertext is
not enough to be sure that nobody tampered with its content. For
integrity, you should always append a MAC to the content.

<p>
You use MACs as follows. Let's say that you want to store a file on
your file-server, but you are afraid that its content will be changed
behind your back.  Then, you use a secret key to "mac" the file, and
store the resulting MAC along with the file.  Now, when you check back
with your file-server and retrieve your file, you will also retrieve
the MAC that you appended.  Then, you will use the secret key to
compute the MAC again, and if the MAC you just computed is the same as
the value that you retrieved from the file-server, then you are sure
that nobody touched your file. This is because, if somebody had
changed the file, then they should have computed the corresponding MAC
in order to fool you. However, secure MACs are concocted such that,
without knowing the secret key, it is computationally intractable to
compute the right MAC, even after having seen a lot of valid
(message, MAC) pairs. 

<p>
The <a
href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips198/fips-198a.pdf">Keyed-Hash
Message Authentication Code (HMAC)</a> <b>[FIPS-198a]</b> is a secure Message
Authentication Code based on the use of any cryptographic hash
function, like SHA-1.
The libraries you are using contain an implementation of HMAC,
instantiated with the SHA-1 cryptographic hash function.

<ul>
<li><code>
void hmac_sha1 (const char *key, size_t keylen, void *out, const void
*data, size_t dlen);</code><br>  

Computes the HMAC over <code>len</code> bytes of data at
<code>buf</code> using the key <code>key</code>, and places
the resulting 20 bytes at <code>out</code>.
</ul>

<p>
Similarly to what discussed for the case of SHA-1, the libraries you
are using allow you to process a long input "one chunk at a time."

<p>
<ul>
<li><code>void hmac_sha1_init (const char *key, size_t keylen,
sha1_ctx *sc);</code><br>

Initializes the <code>sha1_ctx struct</code> that will contain the
partial HMAC under the key <code>key</code>.

<p>
<li><code>void hmac_sha1_update (sha1_ctx *sc, const void *data, size_t
len);</code><br> 

Adds <code>len</code> bytes from <code>data</code> to the input being
hmac'ed, but does not produce a result.  Thus, one can hmac a large
amount of data without having it all in memory, by calling
<code>hmac_sha1_update</code> on one chunk at a time.<br>
Notice that the key is not needed when adding chunks.

<p>
<li><code>void hmac_sha1_final (const char *key, size_t keylen,
sha1_ctx *sc, void *out);</code><br> 

Produces the final HMAC, and places the resulting 20 bytes at
<code>out</code>. <br>
Notice that the result is undefined if the <code>key</code> used in
<code>hmac_sha1_final</code> is different from the one initially used in
<code>hmac_sha1_init</code>.
